🍎🍇🍋 Classification Demo: Fruit & Vegetable Classification 🍅🥕🥬
Welcome to the Fruit and Vegetable Classification project! This repository contains the code and model for classifying fruits and vegetables using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

🚀 Project Overview
The Fruit & Vegetable Classification project aims to accurately identify and classify different types of fruits and vegetables from images. Leveraging the power of machine learning and image processing, this project can help in analyzing the quality of produce and providing nutritional information.

The key features of this project include:

Image classification using a trained deep learning model.
Detection of fruit and vegetable types.
Future plans to analyze freshness and provide vitamin and nutrient information.

🔍 How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed by resizing and normalizing them to prepare for the model. Augmentation techniques are applied to improve robustness.

Model: A custom-trained neural network is used to classify the images of fruits and vegetables. The model has been trained using a dataset containing various classes of fruits and vegetables.

Training: The model was trained on a dataset of labeled images using transfer learning for better performance and faster results.

Prediction: After training, the model can predict the class of a fruit or vegetable based on the input image.

🔧 Installation & Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ZeelBoda/Classification-Demo.git
   cd Classification-Demo

2. Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages using:
